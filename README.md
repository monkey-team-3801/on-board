## About

DECO3801 2020 Project: **On Board**.

Online collaboration and learning environment powered by SocketIO.

On Board aims to resolve the issue of the online teaching environment. The system will make online learning more engaging by providing and promoting collaboration tools all in one place.

## Contributing

### Requirements

-   Node 12
-   NPM 6 or Yarn

### Developing

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start-client-dev` to initialise the client or
   `npm run start-server-dev` to initialise the server.

    Note in most cases both client and server will need to be running for auth checks to complete.

### Building

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build`

Your output(s) will be in the `/build` folder.

3. Configure your [environment variables](https://github.com/monkey-team-3801/on-board#environment-variables-important).
4. You can then run `npm start` to start the app.

### Deploying

Latest `master` is always deployed to https://on-board-prod.herokuapp.com/ and https://on-board.xyz/

For manual deployment setup your container to run `npm start` (after building).

### Environment Variables (**Important**)

Environment variables must be configured in a `.env` or in your environment before the app can function normally.

MONGODB_URI: MongoDB URI. (Required)

JWT_SECRET: Custom JWT signature. (Optional)

### Other

After the app is running, you may wish to retrieve some sample courses. Simply use `npm run fetch-course` to populate some sample data in to your database.
